The first edition of this book was published in 2012, during a time when open source
    data analysis libraries for Python, especially pandas, were very new and developing
    rapidly. When the time came to write the second edition in 2016 and 2017, I needed
    to update the book not only for Python 3.6 (the first edition used Python 2.7) but also
    for the many changes in pandas that had occurred over the previous five years. Now
    in 2022, there are fewer Python language changes (we are now at Python 3.10, with
    3.11 coming out at the end of 2022), but pandas has continued to evolve.
    In this third edition, my goal is to bring the content up to date with current versions
    of Python, NumPy, pandas, and other projects, while also remaining relatively con
    servative about discussing newer Python projects that have appeared in the last few
    years. Since this book has become an important resource for many university courses
    and working professionals, I will try to avoid topics that are at risk of falling out of
    date within a year or two. That way paper copies won’t be too difficult to follow in
    2023 or 2024 or beyond.
    A new feature of the third edition is the open access online version hosted on my
    website at 
    owners of the print and digital editions. I intend to keep the content reasonably up to
    date there, so if you own the paper book and run into something that doesn’t work
    properly, you should check there for the latest content changes.
